## Inspiration
We've all been there - the night before an interview, struggling to answer "tell me about yourself." A seemingly simple question, but alas, we blank. Planterview is there for you. Plan your answers in advance and get comfortable with interview questions, so you can ace every inquiry they throw your way.

## What it does
Planterview compiles a list of the most popular behavioral interview questions and ranks them by difficulty level, determined by our highly complex algorithm, and gives the user a timer to plan and answer the question. After their time is up, we give them the key points for what the interviewer is looking for alongside a more thorough answer.

## How we built it
Planterview is built with Swift and the SwiftUI framework, utilizing Firebase's Cloud Firestore. We also wrote a Python script to sort the question bank into 3 levels of difficulty. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had to decide how to rank the questions by difficulty, but ultimately we chose a few key factors like question length and the frequency of specific words to decide the level.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created a beautiful design without an official designer, and we wrote the algorithm to sort our questions in record time. 

## What we learned
Some of our members who didn't have experience with Firebase learned how to use it and we got more experience with SwiftUI. We also further learned how to work remotely as a team, which is an important skill during these times.

## What's next for planterview
Our goals are to personalize the app by adding a sign-in and tracking the user's progress. We also want to split the questions into different categories other than level such as differentiating by the target audience, as behavioral questions can somewhat differ between tech roles and non-tech roles. We believe planterview can really help people step up their interview game and be the best version of themselves for their next interview with the help of our app.
